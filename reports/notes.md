* We cannot apply ISOMAP or any manifold learning meathod to reduce the dimensionaly of the adjacency matrix since the order of nodes is crucial and in manifold learning the set of points describe a specific object. Conversely, our matrix is very well defined, if we add any point to the tensor, it becomes incoherent.
* Should we include the objects that have never been in any image ?
* The adjacency matrix is constituted of a batch of filters. Each filter tells about the presence of a specific object in the image. We should consider one-dot matrix product and we keep the matrix as it is. The at the end we apply the conv 1x1 to reduce the number of channels to 1. The reason behind is that we don't want to use sum or mean, but we wanna use a learnable aggregator.
